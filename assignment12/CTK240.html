<p class="GoogFont TextEdit Center">Project 1 - Each student will find/create what they consider to be the most aesthetically pure and beautiful sound possible.   Conversely, each student will also strive to find/create the most terrible sound possible.  The goal is to find/create sounds that cannot be interpreted in any other way except beautiful or terrible.  Do not use music.  Do not use sound effects that tell a story. </p>
</div>

<div class="AMPBox AMPColor2">
	<p class="GoogFont TextEdit Center">Project 2 - Each student will find a song to EQ that has a good balance of bass, midrange, and treble, and at least 30 consecutive seconds where the musical arrangement is consistent. The student will then edit the song to isolate 30 seconds of consistent musical arrangement. Each of the three 10-second sections of music should then be EQed to create three distinctly different feels to the music. Each ‘feel’ should be labeled with a one-word descriptor. Examples: brittle / muffled / shrill / heavy / energetic / nasal. The goal is to make each 10-second portion ‘sound’ like each of your three descriptors using only an EQ. </p>

  <p class="GoogFont TextEdit Center">Project 3 - The student will use recorded dialog and underscore it 3 different ways: two with different clips of music, and once using an environmental ambient sound effect. The dialog track should be approximately 30 seconds long, but can be a bit longer or shorter as needed by the dialog to make sense. Find 2 different musical tracks and one environmental ambient SFX track and save them all in the underscore project folder.</p>
</div>

<div class="AMPBox AMPColor2">
	<p class="GoogFont TextEdit Center">Project 4 - The student will pick a song over 5 minutes in length and restructure (edit) it down to less than 2 minutes. The goal is to make the edited song sound as if it were originally composed in its shortened form. Focus will be on the structure of the new composition and quality of editing.</p>

  <p class="GoogFont TextEdit Center">Project 5 - The student will create a short audio-only narrative occurring in a specific environment. The narrative will be expressed by layering sound effects together to tell the story and define the environment. Project should be at least 1 minute in length and use at least 10 separate sound effects. </p>
